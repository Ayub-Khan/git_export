<p>This exam is designed to take on average roughly 3 hours of time. You can start the exam when it is convenient for you, but you must complete this examination by the deadline. Please look up this time in <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/" target="_blank">your local time zone.</a></p>
<p>Note that during the exam period, the <strong>discussion forum is&nbsp;shut down</strong>, to avoid any accidental discussion of exam material. It will reopen at the end of the exam period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are having technical issues</strong>, please see if there is an answer in the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2016/courseware/c77f2cc9fb2a42589f0d723e8fefbd35/c58684c1812443db80c4b0028aba9bc3/2" target="_blank">"Common Grader Issues" page</a>. Note that global variables will not work with our graders, sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>If you have a bug or error to report during the exam, you may email 6.00.1x-exams@mit.edu. Include your edX ID name (found at the top right of any edX page).&nbsp;<b style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4em; font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif, sans-serif;">Only bug or error reports will be accepted; all other emails will be discarded.&nbsp;</b>We try to respond to emails within 7 hours. Since the entire staff is on the United States east coast, we will take about that long to reply to emails sent overnight and apologize for this inconvenience.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4em; font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif, sans-serif;">If there is an error with the exam, we will fix it and then post a message on the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2016/info" target="_blank">course updates page</a>. Check that page often! </b>It is the fastest way we have to announce errors and fixes.</p>
<p>You may use as a resource anything we posted online (including the textbook), any other textbooks you may possess, and any notes you have prepared yourself. We ask you not to use the Internet to search for solutions. You may not communicate with any person about this examination while working on it. Furthermore, you may not communicate about the exam until the exam has been closed for everyone.</p>
<p>For multiple choice problems you will be allowed exactly one submission; for coding questions you will be allowed 10 submissions, so that you may have a chance to fix any errors.</p>
<p>Part of what we are testing on this exam is your ability to write comprehensive test suites for your own functions, which is why we limit the number of submissions allowed per coding problem. For problems that ask you to write your own code, you may use Anaconda&nbsp;or another IDE - or an online Python interpreter such as <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/" target="_blank">CodeSkulptor</a> or <a href="http://pythontutor.com/" target="_blank">Python Tutor</a> - to test your solution before pasting it into the answer box. We ask that you do not run code provided in non-coding questions in your IDE.</p>
<p>If you want to go back and study some more before starting this exam you can do so.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
