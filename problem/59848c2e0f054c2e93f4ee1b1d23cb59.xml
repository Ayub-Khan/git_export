      Given variables <code>base</code> and <code>num</code> (both &gt; 1), write code that calculates and prints the smallest integer <code>exponent</code> such that <code>base**exponent</code> is strictly greater than <code>num</code>.  
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre># when base == 3 and num == 12, it prints
3
# when base == 2 and num == 8, it prints
4
# when base == 4 and num == 2, it prints
1
</pre>
