        "content": "<p>Welcome to MITx 6.0001!</p>\n\n<p><b>Mandatory Finger Exercises: </b>You will use this site to complete finger exercises. Optional finger exercises are for extra practice -- they will have weights associated with them but will not count towards your grade. <b>Mandatory finger exercises will be available for almost every lecture and will be due by the beginning of the following lecture (3pm).</b> They will be mostly short coding and some non-coding and are worth 10% of your grade in this class. Please check the Stellar Calendar for lectures that have mandatory finger exercises and their corresponding due dates. </p>\n<p><b>Stellar: </b>The most up-to-date information about the class is on Stellar. </p> \n\n<p>\n  <b>Online Discussions:</b> We will use Piazza for all online discussions and questions you may have outside of recitations and office hours.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n  <b>Videos on MITx: </b>The videos on this site may not follow the lectures in class exactly. You do not have to watch the lectures here, and we are providing them in case you would like another take on the material. \n</p>\n\n\n  \n<p>The faculty and course TAs are looking forward to working with you this term, and we hope that you will have a great time learning about programming and computation. We are excited to have you all join us! </p>\n",
