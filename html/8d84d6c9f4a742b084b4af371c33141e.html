<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;">A large part of programming is being able to write understandable&nbsp;code and read code from other people. The course code graders are able to grade you on correctness but not on style. This problem will give you practice with (1) writing code that will be read by others and (2) understanding code that others wrote.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;">You will&nbsp;<strong>upload a .py file</strong>&nbsp;and your code will be graded by 3 of your peers on its coding style: readability, code comments, variable names, and modularity.&nbsp;<strong>In the box you can type anything, like "file attached".</strong>&nbsp;This is an optional exercise, but worthwhile to attempt!&nbsp;</p>
