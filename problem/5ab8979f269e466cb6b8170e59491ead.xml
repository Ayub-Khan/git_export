      Implement a function that meets the specifications below. </p>
    <pre>def customsum(t):
    """ t, a tuple of numbers
    Returns a function.
    The function returned should take in one parameter, x, which is a number,  
    and return the sum of x*i over all i, where i is each element in t. 
    """
    # Your code here</pre>
    <p>For example, <code>print(customsum((1,2,3))(5))</code> prints <code>30</code> because it does 5*1+5*2+5*3.</p>
    <p>Paste your entire function, including the definition, in the box below. Do not leave any debugging print statements.</p>
