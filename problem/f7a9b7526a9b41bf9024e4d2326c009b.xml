      Write a Python function that returns the sum of the pairwise differences of <code>L1</code> and <code>L2</code>. You should assume that <code>L1</code> and <code>L2</code> are non-empty lists of integers that have the same length. For example, if <code>L1 = [1, 2, 3]</code> and <code>L2 = [1, 3, 1]</code>,
      the sum of the pairwise difference is <code>(1-1) + (2-3) + (3-1) = 1</code>, meaning your function should return:
      <code>1</code>.</p>
    <pre>def diffs(L1, L2):
    '''
    Assumes: L1 and L2 are non-empty lists of the same length of ints
    Effects: returns the sum of the pairwise differences of L1 - L2.
    For example, if L1 = [1,2,3] and L2 = [1,3,1] it returns 1. (Because
    (1-1) + (2-3) + (3-1) = 1.)

  <p><b>Note on Score Shown:</b> Your code will ultimately be run on our test cases. Getting "Correct"/green check during the exam does not mean you will get full points. The test cases here ensure you do not have a copy/paste error from your IDE.
