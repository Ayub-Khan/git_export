      Write a Python function <code>f</code> that takes an input string <code>s</code> and returns a dictionary that maps each character that occurs in <code>s</code> to the number of times it occurs in <code>s</code>. For example, if <code>s = 'a*c3Ca*'</code> the function f should return the dictionary: <code>{'a': 2, '*': 2, 'c': 1, '3': 1, 'C': 1}</code>.  Note that the dictionary keys are case sensitive.</p>

def f(s):
    '''
    Assumes: s is a string
    Effects: returns a dict that maps each character that
             occurs in s to the number of times it occurs in s
             For example, f('a*c3Ca*') returns the dict
             {'a': 2, '*': 2, 'c': 1, '3': 1, 'C': 1}
