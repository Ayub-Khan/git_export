Write a piece of Python code that uses a loop (while or for) to sum the
odd integers from 1 through <code>end</code>, inclusive. <code>end</code> is a variable that we define
for you. So, for example, if we define <code>end</code> to be 7, your code should print out
      the result: <code>Sum of odd numbers: 16</code>, which is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7.</p>
    <p>Hint: There are two different approaches to this problem.Either have a loop
that only goes through odd numbers, or test at each iteration whether the
  number is odd or even.</p>
    <p>For problems such as these, do not include <code>input</code> statements or define the
variables we give you. Our automated testing will provide values for you, so
  write your code in the following box assuming they are already defined.
