      <i>
      Write a Python function that meets the following specification:</i>
    </p>
    <pre>def mutate_dict(d, other):
    """
    d and other: dictionaries that map int:int
    Mutates d. If a key in other is already in d, changes 
    the value of the key in d to be the value in other.
    If a key in other is not in d, adds the key:value pair to d. 
    Does not return anything.
    """
</pre>
    <p>For example, </p>
    <pre>
d = {1:2, 2:3}
other = {3:4, 2:1}
mutate_dict(d, other)
print(d) # this prints {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 4} or some other order of the key:value pairs
    </pre>
