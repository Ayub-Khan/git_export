Write a Python function, twoQuadratics, that takes in two sets of coefficients
and x-values, sums the results of evaluating two quadratic
equations and prints the result. That is, you should evaluate the following equation:
      [mathjaxinline]a_1*x_1^2 + b_1*x_1 + c_1 + a_2*x_2^2 + b_2*x_2 + c_2[/mathjaxinline]</p>
    <p>You should use the <code>evalQuadratic</code> function you defined in the "Quadratic" problem of these exercises (you don't need to redefine <code>evalQuadratic</code>
        in this box; when you call <code>evalQuadratic</code>, our definition will be used).</p>
    <p>This function takes in 8 numbers and does not return anything.</p>
    <pre>def twoQuadratics(a1, b1, c1, x1, a2, b2, c2, x2):

    a1, b1, c1: one set of coefficients of a quadratic equation
    a2, b2, c2: another set of coefficients of a quadratic equation
    x1, x2: values at which to evaluate the quadratics
